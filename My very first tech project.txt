    A PIECE OF BAKE WEBSITE IDEAS

1. homepage....
  *What I want is like a page with a piece of bake logo and design or whatnot, then clicking on any part of the website leads to the actual homepage
   * The homepage should have the remaining characteristics of the website as follows
    a.Business description...comes first
       -Amaka's name and picture
        -Facts about the business
        -How the business operates
    b.catalogue and prices...next
       -Basically price list
    c. Placing Orders
       -Na here work dey pass...
   d.customer reviews...at the foot of the website but easy to spot and appealing enough to be read
placing orders
