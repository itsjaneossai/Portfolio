            <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi everyone, my name is Ossai Onyekachi. I'm a computer science student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, with a strong passion for technology and innovation. With a solid foundation in mathematics, programming languages, and software development, I'm excited to explore new opportunities and challenges in the tech industry.

As a curious and goal-driven individual, I thrive in team-based settings and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. My experience as a student, in Poltics, as an IYMC contestant and pagentry has taught me the importance of determination, perseverance, collaboration, problem-solving, adaptabiity and many more.

I'm committed to being the best version of myself and contributing to meaningful projects that align with my values and interests. Some of my areas of interest include Web developmemnt, artificial intelligence, and web3 smart contract developmemnt.

When I'm not studying or working on projects, you can find me admiring art, or watching a movie. Music is my lifestyle. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and learn from their experiences. </p>
